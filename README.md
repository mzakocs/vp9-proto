# vp9-proto

A basic protobuf specification for the VP9 video frame format. Includes converters written in C++ that can convert the protobufs to binary format and vice versa. Specification and converters are only semi-compatible with inter-frames. May be useful for experimenting with VP9, inspecting frames, networking, and fuzzing.
